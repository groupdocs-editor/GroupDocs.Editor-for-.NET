## Major Features

Main feature of the GroupDocs.Editor for .NET version 19.11 is support of .NET Standard 2.0. This means that now GroupDocs.Editor for .NET includes new NET Standard 2.0 version. It has the full functionality of .NET Framework version.

In this version, we also have changed the unique identifier that OS uses to identify the application installed with an MSI package. Please manually uninstall the previous installation of GropuDocs.Editor for .NET before installing GroupDocs.Editor for .NET 19.11.

Also, we updated online documentation (API references), some XML docs and NUSPEC description on NuGet.org to reflect the latest changes in GroupDocs.Editor.
